# Simple Discord Music Bot

This is a simple Discord music bot developed to accept YouTube URLs and play music. The bot features basic commands such as `play`, `stop`, and `skip`.

## About

I developed this bot for use on my server with friends, and it's working perfectly. Feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

I used the Discord Player library to handle music playback. You can find more information in the official documentation: [discord-player.js.org](https://discord-player.js.org/).

## How to Install

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory, following the format of the `.env.example` file.
4. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

With that, the bot will be ready to be added to your Discord server and start playing music. Enjoy!
